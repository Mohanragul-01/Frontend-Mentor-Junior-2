# FrontEnd_Mentor_Newbie_Challenges_1

This repository features the first set of **Frontend Mentor** challenges I completed at the **junior** difficulty level. These projects focus on mastering the basics of modern frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on responsive design and clean layouts.

### Links to the challenges I completed:

01. advice-generator-app - https://advice-generator-app-nine-puce.vercel.app/

02. browser-extensions-manager-ui - https://browser-extensions-manager-ui-mu.vercel.app/

03. crowdfunding-product-page - https://crowdfunding-product-page-beige.vercel.app/

04. product-list-with-cart - https://product-list-with-cart-amber-five.vercel.app/

05. social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher - https://social-media-dashboard-with-theme-s.vercel.app/

Each project was deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and helped me practice essential frontend techniques including component-based layouts, basic interactivity, and responsive styling.

Iâ€™ll continue building more solutions and advancing through the challenge levels to grow as a frontend developer.
